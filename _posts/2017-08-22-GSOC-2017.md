title: GSoC 2017 -  DBpedia Mappings Front-End Administration
---

### Project Description

This project goal was to create a web application (comprised of a frontend and backend) that provides a user-friendly interface so the DBpedia community can easily view, create and administrate DBpedia mapping rules using the new RML format. The developed system includes user administration features, help posts, Github mappings synchronization, and rich RML related features such as syntax highlighting, RML code generation from templates, RML validation, extraction and statistics. Part of these features are possible thanks to interaction with the DBPedia Extraction Framework.

This project fills a missing gap in DBpedia infrastructure: Although the DBPedia Extraction Framework was adapted to support RML mappings thanks to a project of last year GSoC, the user interface to create mappings was still done by a MediaWiki installation, not supporting RML mappings and needing expertise on Semantic Web. 

### Results

Although there was an initial list of requirements, some of them where changed, some removed, and some were added while the project was being developed. However, at the end, all the functionalities and goals that were required have been developed, with many functional tests and the approval of the DBpedia community. The system is ready for production deployment.
Hence, we can conclude that the project development has been successful.

Here it is a list of the principal features/goals developed:

* User account management.
* User groups and permissions management.
* Help posts management (creation/edition/view/removal) with markdown support.
* Webprotege integration to edit ontology.
* Mapping list with statistics and rich search.
* Mapping view and edition with ACE editor and RDF syntax checker.
* Wikipedia extraction from a mapping.
* RML generation from multiple mapping templates, embedded in mapping editor.
* Mapping history to keep old versions.
* Two-way mapping synchronization with Github repository, with support of pre-commit validations.
* Connection to Extraction Framework to obtain mapping related data and operations.
* Dockerized
