title: GSoC 2017 -  DBpedia Mappings Front-End Administration
---

### Project Description

This project goal was to create a web application (comprised of a frontend and backend) that provides a user-friendly interface so the DBpedia community can easily view, create and administrate DBpedia mapping rules using the new RML format. The developed system includes user administration features, help posts, and rich RML related features such as syntax highlighting, RML code generation from templates, RML validation, extraction and statistics. Part of these features are possible thanks to interaction with the DBPedia Extraction Framework.

This project fills a missing gap in DBpedia infrastructure: Although the DBPedia Extraction Framework was adapted to support RML mappings thanks to a project of last year GSoC, the user interface to create mappings was still done by a MediaWiki installation, not supporting RML mappings and needing expertise on Semantic Web.
